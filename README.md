**Hacking tactics, techniques, and procedures for testing web applications and APIs**

## What is this book about?
Security is an ever-changing, fast-paced discipline. Thankfully, there are free tools that you can use to protect your systems. OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is the most popular one: it allows you to test for vulnerabilities and exploits with the same functionality as a licensed tool! But how does it work?

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Install ZAP on different operating systems or environments
* Explore how to crawl, passively scan, and actively scan web apps
* Discover authentication and authorization exploits
* Conduct client-side testing by examining business logic flaws
* Use the BOAST server to conduct out-of-band attacks
* Understand the integration of ZAP into the final stages of a CI/CD pipeline

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter11.

The code will look like the following:
```
pipeline { 
   agent any 
   parameters { 
          choice(name: "ZAP_SCAN", choices: ["zap-baseline.py", "zap-full-scan.py"], description: "Parameter to choose type of ZAP scan") 
          string(name: "ENTER_
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, application security engineers, DevSecOps engineers, students interested in web security, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and anyone from the open source cybersecurity community looking to gain expertise in ZAP.
